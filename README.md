# 🏏 Cricket Match Prediction
Predicting the outcome of cricket matches based on fantasy team player performance using historical data and machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a cricket match based on player statistics, team combinations, and match conditions.
It uses historical cricket match data from Cricsheet to extract batting, bowling, and team performance metrics.

###📌 Key Features:

✅ Fantasy Team-Based Predictions – Users input two teams, and the model predicts the winning probability.
✅ Data Processing Pipeline – Converts raw match JSON files into structured datasets.
✅ Feature Engineering – Aggregates player stats into team-level performance indicators.
✅ Machine Learning Models – Tests different ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) to optimize predictions.
✅ Web App Integration (Future) – Deploy a web-based interface for user-friendly predictions.
